# NumberWizard
Pick a number between 1 and 1000, and the Number Wizard will guess it - or at least, he'll keep trying to guess your number until he finally does!

*This project is part of a tutorial and is for experimental/learning purposes only. It is now complete and will not be updated further.*

## User Guide
    1. Before starting the game, you must think of a number between 1 and 1000. 
    2. Once you've thought of your number, start the game, and the Number Wizard's first guess will be displayed on the screen.
    3. If his guess is incorrect, select "Higher" or "Lower" to guide him to his next guess.
    4. Once he guesses your number, select "That's it!"
